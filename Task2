Task
Mary is a famous shopkeeper who sells n items in her shop. She assigns each item a unique popularity rating in the inclusive range from 1 to n.

The shop only has one shelf, so the items are displayed array-style in a single row spanning from left to right in a random order. She wants to rearrange the items on the shelf by decreasing popularity rating such that the rating for the i item is always greater than the popularity rating of the (i + 1) item. Mary can swap any two items, i and j, in a single operation.

Specification
minimum_swaps(ratings)
Parameters
ratings: Array (of Integers) - an array of numbers indicating the popularity rating of each item on the shelf.

Return Value
Integer - denotes the minimum number of swap operations Mary must perform to order all n items by decreasing popularity rating.

Constraints
n = number of items in ratings array

each rating value (arri) will be unique

1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 105

1 ≤ arri ≤ n

Examples
ratings	Return Value
Example #1	[3,1,2]	1
Example #2	[3,1,2,4]	2
Explanation for Example #1
Mary can perform the following minimal sequence of swap operations to successfully sort all 3 items by decreasing popularity rating: [3, 1, 2] → [3, 2, 1].

Thus, we return 1 as our answer.

Explanation for Example #2
Mary can perform the following minimal sequence of swap operations to successfully sort all 4 items by decreasing popularity rating: [3, 1, 2, 4] → [3, 4, 2, 1] → [4, 3, 2, 1].

Thus, we return 2 as our answer.
